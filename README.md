## Identity and Access Management (IAM) Project: Active Directory (On-Premises) Deployment For DamaniTech Solutions
## Introduction

In modern cybersecurity, Identity and Access Management (IAM) plays a critical role in safeguarding organizational assets by ensuring that only authorized users have the right access to the right resources at the right time. One of the most widely adopted IAM solutions is Microsoft Active Directory (AD), an on-premises directory service that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and account management across enterprise environments.

This project focuses on the deployment of an on-premises Active Directory solution to enhance identity governance, enforce access policies, and strengthen overall cybersecurity posture.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the IAM Active Directory (On-Premises) Deployment project are:

To establish a centralized authentication system for users, devices, and applications.

To implement role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring employees have appropriate access aligned with job functions.

To enhance security monitoring and auditing of user logins, group memberships, and access requests.

To support single sign-on (SSO) for seamless access to enterprise applications.

## Benefits

By deploying an on-premises Active Directory solution, organizations can achieve:

Improved Security – Centralized user management reduces insider threats and unauthorized access.

Operational Efficiency – Automated account provisioning and group policies reduce manual overhead.

Regulatory Compliance – IAM controls support auditability and compliance with security standards.

Scalability – The AD infrastructure can grow with organizational needs, supporting thousands of users and systems.

Enhanced User Experience – SSO and seamless authentication streamline access for end-users.

## Conclusion

The IAM Active Directory (On-Premises) Deployment Project establishes a robust foundation for secure identity and access management within the organization. By centralizing authentication, enforcing least-privilege access, and strengthening governance, the solution enhances cybersecurity defenses while supporting business continuity and compliance requirements.
